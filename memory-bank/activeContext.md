# Active Context - Current Work Focus

## Current Session Focus
**Date**: August 22, 2025  
**Primary Objective**: Initial project setup and memory bank system creation  
**Mode**: Planning and Foundation Building  

## Recent Changes & Accomplishments

### âœ… Project Foundation Setup
- **Completed**: Created GitHub repository `dev-memory-hub`
- **Completed**: Comprehensive README.md with project overview
- **Completed**: Project brief defining core mission and objectives
- **Completed**: Working relationship guide for AI collaboration
- **In Progress**: Memory bank system completion

### ðŸ”„ Current Implementation Status
- **Repository Structure**: Basic setup with essential documentation
- **Memory Bank**: Core files being created (projectbrief.md, working-relationship.md)
- **Next Steps**: Complete memory bank system and project structure
- **Development Environment**: Ready for core development to begin

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### 1. Project Architecture
**Decision**: Start with core memory engine and CLI, then expand to IDE integrations  
**Rationale**: Build foundation first, validate core functionality, then add complexity  
**Implementation**: Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns  

### 2. Technology Stack
**Decision**: Node.js + TypeScript for backend, React + Next.js for frontend  
**Rationale**: Familiar technology stack, excellent ecosystem, strong community support  
**Implementation**: Core packages structure with shared dependencies  

### 3. Development Approach
**Decision**: Open-source first with community-driven development  
**Rationale**: Maximize adoption, encourage contributions, build ecosystem  
**Implementation**: Comprehensive documentation, contribution guidelines, examples  

## Next Steps & Immediate Actions

### ðŸ”´ High Priority - This Session
1. âœ… **Create GitHub repository**: Repository established with basic structure
2. âœ… **Setup project documentation**: README and project brief completed
3. âœ… **Create working relationship guide**: AI collaboration patterns defined
4. **Complete memory bank system**: Create remaining essential files
5. **Setup project structure**: Create packages and development environment

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority - Next Session
1. **Core memory engine development**: Start building the memory storage and retrieval system
2. **CLI interface**: Create command-line tools for memory management
3. **Testing framework**: Set up comprehensive testing infrastructure
4. **CI/CD pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority - This Week
1. **IDE extension planning**: Design architecture for Cursor and VS Code integrations
2. **Web dashboard design**: Plan React-based management interface
3. **Documentation expansion**: Create detailed development and user guides
4. **Community setup**: Establish contribution guidelines and issue templates

## Technical Context & Constraints

### Current Infrastructure Status
- **Repository**: GitHub repository created and ready
- **Documentation**: Foundation documents in place
- **Structure**: Basic project organization established
- **Development**: Ready to begin core development

### Development Environment
- **Local**: Node.js development environment needed
- **Testing**: Jest and testing framework to be configured
- **Build**: TypeScript compilation and bundling setup
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow to be created

## Collaboration Patterns & Preferences

### Effective Communication Methods
- **Structured Responses**: Analysis â†’ Todo â†’ Plan â†’ Questions format
- **Visual Todo Lists**: Checkboxes with priority and effort indicators
- **Phase References**: Connect tasks to roadmap phases and objectives
- **Approval Workflow**: Wait for explicit go-ahead before implementation

### Quality Standards & Expectations
- **Production-Ready Code**: No quick fixes or prototypes
- **Security First**: No hardcoded secrets or security shortcuts
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting code with clear intent
- **Performance**: Optimize for both functionality and user experience

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Current Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Initial project scope could expand too quickly
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on core MVP, defer advanced features to later phases
   
2. **Technology Complexity**: Memory engine and IDE integration are complex
   - **Mitigation**: Modular approach with clear interfaces and testing
   
3. **Community Adoption**: Open-source projects need active community
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation, examples, and easy onboarding

### Success Metrics
- **Repository Setup**: Complete project structure and documentation
- **Core Development**: Functional memory engine with CLI interface
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage and CI/CD pipeline
- **Documentation**: Clear setup guides and contribution guidelines

## Open Questions & Clarifications Needed

### Technical Decisions
1. **Database Choice**: SQLite for local development, PostgreSQL for cloud sync?
2. **Search Implementation**: Elasticsearch vs. PostgreSQL full-text search?
3. **Memory Format**: JSON vs. structured database schema?
4. **Plugin Architecture**: How extensible should the system be?

### Development Approach
1. **MVP Scope**: What's the minimum viable product for initial release?
2. **Testing Strategy**: How comprehensive should testing be from the start?
3. **Documentation**: What level of detail is needed for community adoption?
4. **Performance**: What are the performance requirements for memory operations?
