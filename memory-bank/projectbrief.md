# Project Brief: Dev Memory Hub

## Project Overview

**Dev Memory Hub** is an open-source alternative to ByteRover that provides a persistent memory layer for AI coding agents. This project aims to democratize AI memory technology by making it free, open-source, and self-hostable while maintaining enterprise-grade quality and features.

## Core Mission

Build and deploy a comprehensive memory management system that serves as a demonstration of:
- **Open Source Excellence**: High-quality, community-driven development
- **AI Integration**: Seamless integration with modern IDEs and development tools
- **Privacy & Control**: Self-hosted solution with complete data ownership
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared knowledge and context across development teams
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for custom integrations and use cases

## Primary Objectives

### 1. Core Memory Engine
- **Persistent Storage**: Reliable memory persistence across sessions and restarts
- **Intelligent Retrieval**: Context-aware memory search and suggestions
- **Memory Management**: Creation, updating, deletion, and versioning of memories
- **Performance**: Fast search and retrieval for large memory databases

### 2. IDE Integration
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Cursor, VS Code, JetBrains, and other IDEs
- **Seamless Experience**: Native integration with development workflows
- **Memory Generation**: Automatic memory creation from code and interactions
- **Context Awareness**: Intelligent memory suggestions based on current work

### 3. Team Collaboration
- **Shared Memories**: Collaborative knowledge sharing across teams
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions and security
- **Memory Templates**: Standardized formats for different use cases
- **Export/Import**: Memory portability across projects and organizations

### 4. Enterprise Features
