# Getting Started with Dev Memory Hub

Welcome to Dev Memory Hub! This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepakaryan1988/dev-memory-hub.git
cd dev-memory-hub
```

### 2. Run the Setup Script
```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x scripts/setup.sh

# Run the setup
./scripts/setup.sh
```

### 3. Open in Cursor
```bash
# Open the project in Cursor
cursor .
```

That's it! The AI will automatically read the memory bank and understand the project context.

## 🧠 What Happens When You Open in Cursor

### **Automatic Memory Bank Reading**
- AI reads all memory bank files
- Understands project structure and goals
- Knows how to collaborate effectively
- Maintains context across sessions

### **Project Intelligence**
- Follows structured response format
- Creates problem-focused todo lists
- Maintains quality standards
- Updates memory bank automatically

### **Working Patterns**
- Analysis → Todo → Plan → Questions format
- Production-ready code expectations
- Security-first approach
- Comprehensive documentation

```

## 🎯 Your First Development Session

### **1. Ask the AI to Analyze the Project**
```
"Can you analyze the current project status and tell me what to work on next?"
```

### **2. Request a Development Plan**
```
"I want to start building the core memory engine. Can you create a plan?"
```

### **3. Get Help with Implementation**
```
"I'm working on the memory storage system. Can you help me design the database schema?"
```

## 🛠️ Development Commands

### **Core Development**
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development mode
npm run build        # Build the project
npm test            # Run tests
npm run lint        # Check code quality
```

### **Package-Specific**
```bash
npm run dev:core    # Develop core package
npm run dev:cli     # Develop CLI package
npm run dev:web     # Develop web dashboard
```

### **Quality Assurance**
```bash
npm run test:coverage  # Generate coverage report
npm run type-check     # Check TypeScript types
npm run format         # Format code with Prettier
```

## 🧠 Memory Bank System

### **What It Does**
- **Persistent Context**: AI remembers everything across sessions
- **Project Intelligence**: Understands your project patterns and preferences
- **Quality Standards**: Enforces consistent code quality and documentation
- **Collaboration**: Maintains effective working relationship patterns

### **Key Files**
- **projectbrief.md**: Project mission, goals, and success criteria
- **activeContext.md**: Current development focus and next steps
- **working-relationship.md**: How to collaborate with AI effectively
- **progress.md**: What's completed and what's left to build

### **How to Use**
1. **Read**: AI automatically reads memory bank files
2. **Update**: AI updates relevant files after significant changes
3. **Maintain**: Keep context current and relevant
4. **Leverage**: Use for consistent development across sessions

## 🔧 Customization

### **Personal Preferences**
- Update `working-relationship.md` with your collaboration style
- Modify `.cursorrules` for specific AI behavior
- Customize memory bank structure for your needs

### **Project-Specific**
- Update `projectbrief.md` for your project goals
- Modify `activeContext.md` for current work focus
- Add new memory bank files for specific domains

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **Setup Script Fails**
```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version  # Should be 18+

# Check npm version
npm --version   # Should be 8+

# Manual setup
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

#### **AI Doesn't Understand Project**
- Ensure `.cursorrules` file exists
- Check that memory bank files are present
- Verify Cursor is reading the project correctly

#### **Build Errors**
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
npm run clean
npm install
npm run build
```
